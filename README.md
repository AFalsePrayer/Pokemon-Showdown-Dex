This is a repository for Pokémon Showdown's Pokédex.

This is what runs `dex.pokemonshowdown.com`.

Important features include:

- **Instant search** - start typing and search results will appear instantly

- **Filter search** - in the Pokémon search tab, type "prankster, twave" and press Enter to get a list of Pokémon with Prankster that can learn Thunder Wave

- **Panel UI** - clicking on anything will load it in a new panel to the right, for ease of navigation

- **Good layout** - get at important information with much less scrolling compared to most other Pokédexes

- **Basic inexact search** - type "pikaku" and Pikachu will still appear

- **Abbreviation search** - type "hjk" to match High Jump Kick

- **Nickname search** - type commonly-used community names like "pdon" to match Primal Groudon
