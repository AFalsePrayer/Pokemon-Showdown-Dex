# Critical hit

All damaging moves with damage calculated through base power have a chance to critical hit, which multiplies the damage dealt by 1.5. If the move's user has the [[Sniper]] Ability, damage from a critical hit is again multiplied by 1.5.

Most moves start at a critical hit ratio of +0, although high critical hit ratio moves (like [[Stone Edge]]) start at +1, and [[10,000,000 Volt Thunderbolt]] starts at +2. [[Frost Breath]] and [[Storm Throw]] always result in a critical hit.

| Ratio | Rate   | Percentage |
|------:|:------:|-----------:|
| +0    | 1/24   |       4.2% |
| +1    | 1/8    |      12.5% |
| +2    | 1/2    |      50.0% |
| +3    | always |     100.0% |

Items that increase critical hit ratio:

- [[Razor Claw]]: +1
- [[Scope Lens]]: +1
- [[Stick]]: +2 ([[Farfetch'd]] only)
- [[Lucky Punch]]: +2 ([[Chansey]] only)

Abilities that increase critical hit ratio:

- [[Super Luck]]: +1

Temporary effects that increase critical hit ratio:

- Focus Energy effect: +2 until switch-out, granted by:
    - [[Focus Energy]]
    - Z-[[Foresight]]
    - Z-[[Sleep Talk]]
    - Z-[[Tailwind]]
    - Z-[[Acupressure]]
    - Z-[[Heart Swap]]
    - [[Lansat Berry]] when eaten

- Laser Focus effect: +3 until the end of the next turn, granted by:
    - [[Laser Focus]]

Note that the Focus Energy effect doesn't stack with itself - you can only have one Focus Energy effect at a time.

Critical hits are prevented from striking a Pokemon under the effect of [[Lucky Chant]], as well as Pokemon with the [[Battle Armor]] and [[Shell Armor]] Abilities.
