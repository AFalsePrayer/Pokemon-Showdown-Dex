# Critical hit

All damaging moves with damage calculated through base power have a chance to critical hit.

Most moves start at a critical hit ratio of +0, although high critical hit ratio moves (like [[Stone Edge]] start at +1), and [[10,000,000 Volt Thunderbolt]] starts at +2.

| Ratio | Rate   | Percentage |
|------:|:------:|-----------:|
| +0    | 1/24   |       4.2% |
| +1    | 1/8    |      12.5% |
| +2    | 1/2    |      50.0% |
| +3    | always |     100.0% |
